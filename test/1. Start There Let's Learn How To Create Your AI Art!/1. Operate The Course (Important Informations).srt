00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:07,413
Before we dive straight to the entire materials, I would  to show you how to effectively operate the course.

2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:14,437
First things first, one of the most important fact is that this course has been adapted for playback at 1.25

3
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,603
or even 1.5 speed alright?

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:27,294
To enable this option you need to go over  there, click here and just consider choosing the speed 1.25 or even 1.5.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,743
Below our course window we have our different tabs.

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:49,117
The first one is the overview, here you can find the information about the entire course, alright, so there if I go  here and click show more, there you have the description, the features, about me and everything  there, ok?

7
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:59,164
Next we have the space called Q&A, where you can ask your questions or just search for the answers for already explained topics.

8
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:05,948
I try to respond there as soon as possible, but it can take maximum 48 hours, alright?

9
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:12,873
Then we have the notes, where you can just leave the note in specific part of the lecture, alright?

10
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:19,397
Next the section announcements, where you can find a lot of useful information that we are sharing with you.

11
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:27,143
for example our best product recommendations for you and there you have entire information  now.

12
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:34,249
At the  side of the page you have the entire course content with the specific chapters and lectures, alright?

13
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:43,537
And the most important fact is that there you have the resources, so this is the space where I will provide for you the links, the files to download etc.

14
00:01:44,678 --> 00:02:08,113
Afterwards, we have the options in our window, so we already covered the playback rate alright, at the  side we have the transcript so we can check what will be in this lecture, the captions alright, so there we have a lot of different languages, then we have the settings when we can change the quality of the video or download the lecture when it is possible.

15
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:11,634
Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not, alright?

16
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:15,776
And then the last one option to go over with the full screen.

17
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:20,198
And the last one option at the  top corner is to leave a review.

18
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:23,779
I don't recommend to do this when you're starting the course.

19
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:30,222
Just take your time and leave it when you would  and you will consume a lot of materials, alright?

20
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:38,145
and I really appreciate it because it helps me to understand what I'm doing great and what not, alright?

21
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:41,387
So if you would , please leave me your honest review.

22
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,647
So that we have it.

23
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:49,390
In this lecture we covered how to operate the course, therefore let's now go straight forward to the materials.
